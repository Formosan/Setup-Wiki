This document states how the proxyList is maintained for Disconnect Inc
=========================================================================

Proxy list is maintained on redis server residing at location:
  dashboard.disconnect.me

Maintaining proxyList:
  1. ssh into dashboard.disconnect.me
  2. start redis server
  3. lrange 0 3 proxyList ---> this will show the proxy EC2 instances that will be kept alive
  4. ltrim 0 3 proxyList ---> this will only keep the above entries in the redis server and clear the rest
  5. publish proxyListEvent 'maintenance' ---> this will tell all servers to update their proxy server list.

Log into console.aws.amazon.com
  1. clear all instances with AMI ID ami-22af0e4b not on the redis server list
